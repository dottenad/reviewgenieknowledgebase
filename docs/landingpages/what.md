# What Is A Landing Page?

A **Landing Page** is a dedicated page where you send your customers to collect reviews through ReviewStream. These pages serve as the bridge between your business and your customer’s feedback.

You can share a landing page via email, SMS, QR code, or even embed it on your website—making it easy to reach customers wherever they are.

Every landing page in ReviewStream is tied to one or more **Items** (the products or services you're collecting reviews for) and can also include **Giveaways** to incentivize participation.

## 🧭 Two Types of Landing Pages

ReviewStream offers two types of landing pages—each with a specific purpose:

### 📋 Survey Pages

Survey pages are built for **incentivized feedback**. They're ideal when you're offering a giveaway (like a coupon or product) in exchange for a review.

-   Collect structured feedback (e.g., star ratings, written reviews, images)
-   Gather order numbers or proof of purchase
-   Deliver a free gift (coupon or product) upon completion
-   Direct the customer to a public review platform of your choosing to leave their review

Perfect for:

-   First-party review collection
-   Post-purchase customer engagement
-   Promotions where a gift is included
-   Driving reviews to platforms like Amazon, Google, or Yelp

### 🌟 Review Pages

Review pages are focused on **getting more reviews on public platforms**. They’re designed to capture a basic review first, then route the user to the appropriate review platform (like Google, Amazon, or Yelp).

-   Collect a quick 1–5 star rating and short feedback
-   Qualify users before redirecting them to the platform
-   Optionally offer a giveaway after platform review is complete

Perfect for:

-   Driving external review volume
-   Gating review traffic to preferred platforms
-   Enhancing your presence on public review sites

## 🔁 Reusability & Flexibility

Both types of landing pages can be used in multiple campaigns and support:

-   Multiple Items (products, services, or locations)
-   Platform-specific customization
-   Smart routing logic based on user response
-   Integrated Giveaways (optional but encouraged)

---

## 🧠 Why Landing Pages Matter

Landing pages are a critical part of your review strategy. They let you:

-   🔗 Share review requests through any channel
-   🧱 Build custom flows based on your goals
-   🎁 Incentivize customers with giveaways
-   📊 Track performance by item, platform, and page

They’re the engine behind how ReviewStream collects, validates, and routes customer feedback.
