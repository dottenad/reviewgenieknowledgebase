# What is a Survey?

A **Survey** in ReviewStream is a landing page designed to collect feedback from your customers. Surveys are commonly used when you're offering a **giveaway**—such as a product or coupon—in exchange for a review.

Surveys help you capture valuable insights and route customers to the platforms of your choosing to leave their reviews.

---

## 🧩 How Surveys Work

Survey pages guide the customer through a multi-step experience where they:

1. Select the product or service they interacted with
2. Leave a star rating and optional written review
3. Upload media (pictures/videos), if required
4. Provide contact information
5. Receive their giveaway reward (if offered)
6. Redirect to your desired platform(s) to leave their review

Surveys are an effective way to **validate responses**, **reward customers**, and **drive public reviews**—all from a single, streamlined flow.

## 🎁 Giveaways (Optional, but Powerful)

Surveys are tightly integrated with **Giveaways**, which serve as incentives for completing the survey. These may include:

-   ✅ Single-use coupon codes
-   ✅ Multi-use coupon codes
-   ✅ Free products shipped to the customer

ReviewStream has integrations available to streamline the fulfillment of product giveaways as to reduce manual data entry.

> 💡 You don’t _have_ to include a giveaway on your survey—but it can significantly increase response rates.

## 🔗 Platform Integration

Surveys are configured to route customers to **external review platforms**. This helps you gather both:

-   First-party feedback (within ReviewStream)
-   Third-party public reviews (Google, Amazon, Yelp, etc.)

Each Item on your survey is connected to one or more **Platforms**, which control where the customer is sent.

---

## ✏️ Customization Options

You can tailor surveys to fit your goals using:

-   **Item-specific rules** (e.g., show only relevant items)
-   **Platform requirements** (e.g., require order number or photo/video)
-   **Giveaway eligibility** (only reward verified respondents)

Each survey is its own self-contained experience that adapts based on your setup.

---

## 🔐 Validation and Eligibility

Surveys support various forms of eligibility logic to ensure rewards are only distributed to real customers. You can:

-   Require a valid order number
-   Use pre-uploaded order lists
-   Use pre-validated links or QR codes.
-   Limit based on star rating (e.g., 4+ stars only)

This helps prevent abuse and keeps your reviews organic and trustworthy.

## 📊 Why Use Surveys?

Surveys are a smart choice when you want to:

-   🧠 Understand customer sentiment with structured data
-   🚀 Incentivize feedback with coupons or free gifts
-   🔗 Drive platform reviews from validated customers
-   🔎 Collect richer data (images, order numbers, comments)
-   🔄 Automate follow-up flows and tracking

They're perfect for post-purchase engagement, beta testing, sampling campaigns, and ongoing review acquisition.
