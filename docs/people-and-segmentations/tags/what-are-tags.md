# What Are Tags?  
A **Tag** in ReviewStream is a label you can assign to contacts or groups to help with organization and segmentation.  
Tags let you categorize customers by attributes or behaviors (e.g. “New Customers,” “Customers who haven't left a review,” “Visited over 1 year ago”) and make it easier to filter, target, or analyze your outreach.

## Why Use Tags?

Tags are useful for:

- Segmenting based on customer attributes (e.g. high-value clients, occasional buyers)  
- Temporarily labeling contacts for campaigns or follow-ups  
- Creating filters and dynamic lists across groups  
- Tracking trends or behavior attributes over time

## What Makes Up a Tag?

A Tag typically includes:

- **Name** – the label text (e.g. “Newsletter Subscriber”, “Low Response”)  
- **Color or Style** *(optional)* – visual cue to differentiate tags  
- **Assigned Contacts / Groups** – where the tag is applied  
- **Date Created** – when the tag was added

## How Tags Fit with Contacts & Groups

- Tags complement Groups — a contact can belong to a group and also carry multiple tags  
- Use tags to fine-tune targeting inside a group  
- Tags can help with ad hoc filtering, campaign segmentation, and reporting
