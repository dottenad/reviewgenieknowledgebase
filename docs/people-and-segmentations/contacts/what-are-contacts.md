# What Are Contacts?

A **Contact** in ReviewStream represents a customer whose details (name, email, and/or phone number) are stored in your account.  
Think of Contacts as the people youâ€™ll be reaching out to when sending review invitations - whether individually or in bulk.

**Contacts** are the foundation of your review outreach. Once added, they can be used in campaigns, one-time invitations, or follow-up reminders.

## When to Add Contacts?

Contacts are useful for:

-   Adding new customers after a completed service or purchase  
-   Uploading a bulk list after an event, workshop, or busy season  
-   Keeping an up-to-date database of customers to request reviews from  
-   Organizing customers into groups for targeted campaigns

## What Makes Up a Contact?

A Contact typically includes:

-   **Name** â€“ first and last name of the customer  
-   **Email** â€“ used for sending email review invitations  
-   **Phone number** â€“ used for sending SMS review invitations  
-   **Status** â€“ whether theyâ€™ve been sent an invitation or left a review  

By keeping these details accurate, youâ€™ll ensure your invitations are delivered and tracked correctly.

-   Quickly send review invitations without re-entering details  
-   Reuse customer information across multiple campaigns
