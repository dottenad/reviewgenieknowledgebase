# What Are Groups?

A **Group** in ReviewStream is a way to organize your Contacts into categories.  
Think of Groups as folders or segments you can use to send targeted review invitations, track engagement, and manage specific audiences.

**Groups** help keep your Contacts structured so you can run campaigns more effectively.

## When to Use Groups?

Groups are useful for:

-   Segmenting customers by service type, purchase, or location  
-   Organizing contacts into lists for recurring campaigns  
-   Tracking review performance for specific customer sets  
-   Managing follow-ups for events, promotions, or seasonal services

## What Makes Up a Group?

A Group typically includes:

-   **Name** – the label you assign (e.g., “New Customers,” “Seattle Clients,” “VIP List”)  
-   **Contacts** – the people you’ve added into that group  
-   **Created Date** – when the group was made  
-   **Actions** – the ability to edit, delete, or use the group in a campaign

## Why Manage Groups?

Managing Groups allows you to:

-   Send campaigns to the right audience  
-   Avoid mixing different types of customers  
-   Improve response rates with personalized targeting  
-   Save time by reusing groups across multiple campaigns
