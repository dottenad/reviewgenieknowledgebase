A **Product** in ReviewStream is an item that your customer purchased from your business. This is one of the two main item types on ReviewStream and is typically used for eCommerce businesses.

A Product is a reviewable entity tied directly to a customer purchase. When someone buys your product—whether on Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, or another platform—you can direct them to the review page for the exact product they purchased from you.

## 🛒 What Qualifies as a Product?

Products can be:

-   Physical goods (e.g., a yoga mat, wireless earbuds, kitchen gadgets)
-   Subscription boxes (e.g., monthly snack or grooming boxes)
-   Digital goods (e.g., eBooks, templates, software downloads)
-   Courses and educational material

If your customer receives a _thing_ from you (digital or physical), it’s a Product.

## 🌐 Supported Platforms for Products

Products are often associated with major online marketplaces and storefronts. ReviewStream currently supports:

-   **Amazon**
-   **Etsy**
-   **Walmart**
-   **Shopify**
-   **Target**
-   ...and many more

Each platform has its own review requirements—such as order validation or proof of purchase. ReviewStream helps you configure each Product correctly per platform.

## 🧠 Why Create a Product?

Creating a Product allows you to:

-   Collect reviews across multiple platforms for the same product
-   Enable validation mechanisms (e.g., order number)
-   Track performance and engagement by product
-   Reuse the product across multiple surveys and campaigns

It’s especially helpful if you sell the same product on multiple channels and want to collect reviews in one streamlined workflow.
