# Add an Email Template

An **Email Template** is a pre-built message format that you can reuse when communicating with customers through ReviewStream. Templates save you time, keep your messaging consistent, and allow you to personalize emails with dynamic placeholders.

Common examples include:

- Welcome emails
- Review requests
- Follow-up reminders
- Product or service updates
- Thank-you messages

You can think of an email template as the foundation for your customer communications. ReviewStream lets you create, save, and reuse templates so your messages stay consistent and personalized.
