# What Is a Campaign?

A **Campaign** in ReviewStream lets you schedule and send review invitations in bulk using a saved template.  
Think of it as a way to follow up with multiple customers at once—by email or text—so you can request reviews at the right time, with a consistent message.

**Campaigns** let you schedule and send review invitations in bulk using a saved template. Use them to send review request follow-ups with selected customers via email or text.

## 📅 When to Use a Campaign?

Campaigns are ideal for:

-   Following up with customers after a completed service
-   Sending bulk invitations after events, workshops, or busy periods
-   Automating reminder sequences to increase review collection
-   Streamlining outreach instead of sending individual requests

## 🛠️ What Makes Up a Campaign?

A Campaign typically includes:

-   **Template** – the saved email or text message you’ll be sending  
-   **Audience** – the selected customers you want to reach  
-   **Schedule** – when the invitations will go out (immediately, or in the future)  
-   **Channel** – email or SMS delivery  

By setting these up once, you can easily re-run or adjust campaigns as your review strategy evolves.
