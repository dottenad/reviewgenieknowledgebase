# What Is An Item?

An **Item** is the product, service, or business you want your customers to leave a review for. In ReviewStream, Items are the building blocks of your review strategy. When you create a landing page in ReviewStream, it’s always tied to at least one Item.

Think of Items as **reviewable entities**. They define **what** you're asking the customer to review.

## 🎯 Item Types

Currently, ReviewStream supports two types of Items:

### 🛍️ Product

A **Product** refers to a physical or digital good you offer—something your customer has purchased or received. This could be:

-   A wireless headset
-   A yoga mat
-   A subscription box
-   A digital course or eBook

Products usually point to eCommerce platforms like:

-   Amazon
-   Etsy
-   Walmart
-   Shopify
-   Target

### 🏢 Business

A **Business** refers to a service provider or company where the **experience itself** is being reviewed. This is ideal for:

-   Real estate agents
-   Home service providers (plumbers, electricians, landscapers)
-   Coffee shops or restaurants
-   Coaches or consultants
-   Medical or wellness professionals

Business-type items often link to platforms like:

-   Google
-   Yelp
-   Facebook
-   Zillow
-   TripAdvisor

Choosing the correct Item type ensures you're aligned with the right metadata and requirements for each platform.

## 🌐 Supported Platforms

Each Item can be connected to one or more **review platforms**, depending on where you want to collect reviews. ReviewStream supports many popular platforms out of the box, including:

-   Amazon
-   Google
-   Etsy
-   Yelp
-   Facebook
-   Trustpilot
-   Zillow
-   ...and many more

> Don’t see what you need? Use the **“Request a Platform”** feature during setup to suggest additional review sites.

Each platform has different **requirements**. For example, some platforms require an order number or proof of purchase. Learn more about how platforms work in [Add a Platform](./add.md) and [Edit a Platform](./edit.md).

## 🧠 Why Items Matter

Items are more than just labels—they power features like:

-   📈 Review tracking and analytics
-   🎯 Targeted review requests
-   🛠️ Platform-specific validation
-   🧾 Survey personalization
-   🔁 Reusability across campaigns

You can reuse the same Item across multiple surveys or promotions, and each one can be customized with platform-specific settings (like images, order number requirements, or validation rules).
