# What Is a Business?

A **Business** in ReviewStream is any service, location, or company where the customer experience itself is being reviewed. This is one of the two primary item types in ReviewStream and is best suited for service-based providers, local businesses, or professionals.

Instead of reviewing a product, the customer is reviewing their **experience**—whether it was with a realtor, a contractor, a restaurant, or a wellness provider.

## 🏢 What Qualifies as a Business?

Businesses can be:

-   Service providers (e.g., plumbers, electricians, landscapers)
-   Professionals (e.g., real estate agents, coaches, consultants)
-   Local businesses (e.g., cafes, salons, medical practices)
-   Brick-and-mortar locations (e.g., retail stores, gyms)

If your customer interacts with **you** or your **staff**—rather than buying a shippable product—it’s probably a Business.

-   **Google My Business**
-   **Yelp**
-   **Facebook**
-   **Zillow**

Each platform has different visibility, validation, and experience guidelines. ReviewStream helps configure them appropriately based on your business type.

## 📈 Why Create a Business Item?

Creating a Business Item allows you to:

-   Centralize feedback from multiple review platforms
-   Drive traffic to your most important public listings
-   Differentiate services or staff within the same business
-   Reuse the Business item in various campaigns and customer journeys

This is especially powerful for service-driven companies and local businesses where online reputation plays a major role in growth.
