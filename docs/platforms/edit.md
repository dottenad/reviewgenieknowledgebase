# How to Edit a Platform

This article outlines how to update a platform in your admin dashboard and explains why certain fields are editable while others are not.

---

## Platform Name (Editable)

The **Platform Name** is used as an internal label to help you identify this platform within your account. This is fully editable and **does not affect** what the customer sees.

**You can update this field anytime.**

## Selected Platform (Not Editable)

The **Selected Platform** refers to the master platform chosen when the platform was first created (e.g., Amazon, Google, Yelp).

**This field is locked** because it determines key platform-specific behaviors. If you were able to change a platform after it has been created and you have already assigned products of businesses to it with their own unique IDs, these products or businesses would break because the platform that the products or businesses were originally created for are now using a different platform.

If you need to associate this configuration with a different platform, delete the current platform and create a new one.

3. Youâ€™ll be returned to your platform list with a confirmation that your changes were saved successfully.
