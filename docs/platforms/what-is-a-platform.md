A **Platform** is a website that allows customers to leave reviews.

Common examples include:

-   **Amazon**
-   **Google**
-   **Facebook**
-   **Yelp**
-   ...and many others.

You can think of a platform as the final destination for the customer's review. ReviewStream helps guide your customers to the correct platform, item, and review page based on your setup.

## Supported Platforms

ReviewStream supports many popular review platforms out of the box. If the platform you need isn't listed, you can request it directly in the app using the **"Request a Platform"** feature.
