Adding a **Platform** in ReviewStream allows you to define where you want your customers to leave their reviews — such as Amazon, Google, or Yelp.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to the Platforms Page

Navigate to the **Platforms** section of the app. You can find it in the main sidebar or by visiting [Platforms Page](https://app.reviewstream.ai/platforms).

### 2. Click “Add Platform” Button

You’ll see a list of all currently active platforms for your account. Click the **“Add Platform”** button to add a new platform.

### 3. Name Your Platform

You can assign a custom internal name to the platform to help you identify it later — for example, "Amazon - Shampoo ASIN" or "Yelp - Downtown Location". This value will **not** be shown to your respondent, but serves only as an internal identifier.

### 4. Choose a Platform

Browse or search our supported platform list. These are pre-configured with review link formats and validation options.

If you don’t see your platform listed:

-   Click the **“Request a Platform”** button
-   Fill in the name and URL of the platform you’d like us to support

### 6. Click “Save”

Once all required fields are filled out, click **Save**. Your new platform will now be available for assigning to items.

## Tips

-   You can add multiple platforms for different products or locations.
-   You can reuse the same platform across multiple review items.
-   If you're unsure where to find platform-specific details, click the **“Where do I find this?”** link next to the input field.

## Next Step

After you've added one or more platforms, you can [assign them to a product or business](../products/add) to begin collecting reviews.
