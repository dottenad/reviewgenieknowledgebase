# Platforms

A **Platform** is where you want your customers to leave their review.

Common examples include:

-   **Amazon**
-   **Google**
-   **Yelp**
-   **Zillow**
-   **TripAdvisor**
-   ...and many others.

You can think of a platform as the final destination for the customer's review. ReviewStream helps guide your customers to the correct platform, item, and review page based on your setup.

## Why Platforms Matter

Collecting reviews on the right platforms helps:

-   Boost credibility where it matters most
-   Improve search visibility and rankings
-   Build trust with future customers
-   Drive more conversions and sales

## Supported Platforms

ReviewStream supports many popular review platforms out of the box. If the platform you need isn't listed, you can request it directly in the app using the **"Request a Platform"** feature.

## Platform Settings

When adding a platform, youâ€™ll be asked to:

-   Select from our list of supported platforms
-   Give it a custom internal name (optional)
-   Optionally provide platform-specific information, such as a product ID, listing URL, or API key (if automatic validation is supported)
