# How ReviewStream Works

Welcome to **ReviewStream** ‚Äì your automated platform for collecting authentic reviews and turning customer experiences into growth!

## üöÄ Step 1: Add Platforms

A "Platform" is where you'd like to collect reviews. This could be Amazon, Google, Yelp, Zillow...basically any online platform that collects reviews!

With ReviewStream, you can create as many platforms as you'd like. You can even create multiple of the same platform. For example, if you have multiple Amazon accounts, you can create 2 or more "Amazon" platforms on ReviewStream.

If you do not see a platform that you'd like to collect reviews on, ReviewStream admins can quickly and easily add them. To request a platform, visit the "Add Platform" page and click the "Request Platform" button.

## üéØ Step 2: Add Items

An "Item" is what you would like your respondent to review. Currently ReviewStream supports 2 types of items: Products and Businesses. A "Product" is a physical item that you sell your customer, such as a pair of shoes or a coffee mug. A "Business" is just that, a business. It's important to select the right item type depending on what you want to get reviews on.

There are 4 things that you need to create an Item on ReviewStream: a name, a platform (i.e. Amazon, Yelp, Google, etc.), a platform "value" (i.e. the unique identifier assigned to every product or business by online platforms), and optionally an item image.

## üéØ Step 3: Create Landing Page

A Landing Page is what you direct your respondent to to provide their review. There are 2 types of Landing Pages on ReviewStream:

1. **Review Page** - A "Review Page" is an interstitial page between your customer and the platform you would like their review on. Directing your customer to a Review Page is a great way to collect your customers feedback on ReviewStream, before directing them off to the platform to leave their review.
2. **Survey Page** - A "Survey Page" allows you to automatically distribute a giveaway to your respondent upon their successful completion of the survey. The Survey Page allows for respondent validation, so only legitimate users are allowed to proceeed into your survey and claim their giveaway.

A Landing Page allows for the addition of as many items as you'd like. For example, say you own 10 car washes where each car wash has it's own unique Google My Business page. Rather than creating a unique Survey Page for all 10 locations, you can create one Survey Page and link all locations back to that one Survey Page, where the customer will then be able to select which car wash they used before proceeding into the survey.

## üì¨ Step 3: Distribute Landing Page

Once you have created you Landing Page, you need to get your respondent to visit it. This can be done a number of ways:

-   **QR Code** - ReviewStream provides a QR Code with every landing page creation. QR Codes are a quick and easy way to get your respondent to your landing page. With a QR code, you can embed this just about anywhere your customer interacts with your business. If you are a restaurant, this can be on your menu, in your reception area, or even on your front door. If you sell products on Amazon, you can include your QR Code on a packing insert that gets delivered to every customer who purchases from you.
-   **Link** - Use a link to request a review from your respondent. This can be sent to your customer over email, text, or posted on Social Media.
-   **Receipt** - If your business generates physical receipts after each purchase, embedding a QR code or a link in your receipt is a great way to easily and effortlessly distribute your review request landing page to every customer. Supercharge this strategy by creating a coupon or product giveaway and a Survey Page to truly boost engagement.
-   **Invoice** - Similar to receipts, embed a QR code and/or a link on every Invoice that is sent to your customers to easily and effortlessly distribute your review request landing pages.
-   **Integrations** - With ReviewStream's Zapier integration, you can integrate ReviewStream with any of Zapier's 7,000+ apps! The possibilities are truly endless with this method of distribution.
-   **Review Stands/Cards/Plates** - Review Stands, Cards, and Plates are a method of collecting reviews that utilize plastic "Stands" in conjunction with QR codes and/or NFC chips to enable simple redirection to your Landing Page on ReviewStream.
-   **Email** - Utilize the automatically generated link to send a review request email to your customer after they have had an interaction with your product or business.
-   **Text** - Similar to email, utilize the automatically generated link to send a review request **text** to your customer after they have had an interaction with your product or business.

## üéÅ Step 4: Reward (Optional)

Want to offer an incentive like a free product or discount?

-   Set up your gift options and automate delivery once the review is complete.
-   This encourages honest reviews while remaining compliant with platform guidelines.

## üìä Step 5: Track and Optimize

Monitor performance in your dashboard:

-   Track reviews by platform, item, and campaign.
-   See which platforms drive the most reviews and optimize your strategy accordingly.
