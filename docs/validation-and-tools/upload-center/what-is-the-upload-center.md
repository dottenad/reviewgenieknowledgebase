# What is the Upload Center?  
The **Upload Center** in ReviewStream is where you can import bulk dataâ€”such as contacts, groups, tags, or entry codesâ€”via CSV or spreadsheet files.  
It streamlines large imports so you donâ€™t have to enter every record manually.

## Why Use the Upload Center?

Using the Upload Center enables you to:

- âœ… Import large numbers of contacts quickly  
- ðŸ”„ Update existing data in bulk  
- ðŸ›  Keep your database organized without manual entry  
- ðŸ“‚ Maintain consistency and reduce errors

## What You Can Upload

- **Contacts** â€“ first name, last name, email, phone, address, etc.  
- **Groups** â€“ assign contacts to groups during import  
- **Tags** â€“ tag contacts as part of the upload  
- **Entry Codes** â€“ bulk import codes with their properties

## How It Works

1. Download a template (CSV/Excel) from the Upload Center interface  
2. Fill in rows with your data (one record per row)  
3. Upload the file through the Upload Center  
4. The system validates the data (e.g., email formats, required fields)  
5. Import completes â€” new records are added or existing ones updated

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use the **template file** exactly â€” do not alter column names  
- Validate email and phone formats before uploading  
- Break big files into smaller batches if you encounter upload errors  
- Use tags or group columns in the upload to automatically categorize  
- Check the upload results page for errors and review the summary
