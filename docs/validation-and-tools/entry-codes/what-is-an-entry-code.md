# What is an Entry Code?  
An **Entry Code** in ReviewStream is a unique access code used to control who can participate in a review distribution or collect reviews.  
It ensures that only authenticated users or intended recipients can submit reviews, improving security and data accuracy.

## Why Use an Entry Code?

Using entry codes helps you:

- âœ… Restrict submissions to invited or authorized users  
- ðŸ‘¤ Prevent unauthorized or spam reviews  
- ðŸš€ Control distribution flows (e.g., event access, loyalty programs)  
- ðŸ“Š Attribute reviews to specific campaigns or audiences

## How Entry Codes Work

1. An **Entry Code** is generated (either automatically or manually) when you set up a distribution campaign.  
2. You share the code with the intended participants (via email, SMS, QR, printed material, etc.).  
3. Recipients enter the code when submitting a review to verify their eligibility.  
4. ReviewStream tracks which codes were used, how many times, and by whom (if linked to contact).

## Use Cases for Entry Codes

- **Event Review Collection** â€” distribute codes at your event so only attendees can leave reviews  
- **Exclusive Offers** â€” send codes to VIP customers to leave feedback on new products  
- **In-store Promotions** â€” print codes on receipts so in-store shoppers can leave reviews online  
- **Campaign Attribution** â€” use different codes for different channels (email, SMS, social) to see which channel drives most reviews

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use **distinct codes** per channel or campaign to track performance  
- **Limit usage** per code if you want to restrict one review per recipient  
- Combine with **Contacts / Groups / Tags** to cross-reference who used which code  
- Clean up unused codes or expire them after the campaign ends
