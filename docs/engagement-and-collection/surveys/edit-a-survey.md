# Edit a Survey

**Editing a Survey** feature in ReviewStream allows you to modify existing surveys you’ve already created.  
You can adjust items, platforms, giveaways, entry validation, rating settings, and more - all without needing to create a new survey from scratch.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to the Surveys Page
In the left-hand navigation, select **“Surveys”** to view your list of all active and inactive surveys.

### 3. Update Survey Name
Edit the **survey name** if you’d like to rename it.  
Your updated name will appear throughout your account and in associated links.

### 4. Update Items to Get Reviews On
Adjust the **items** assigned to your survey as needed.  
If you add or remove items, respondents will see updated options when selecting which product or service they had an experience with.

#### Configure Item Platforms & Giveaways
You can also change which **review platforms** and **giveaways** are connected to each item.

- The available **platforms** come from those added to the item in the [item creation step](../../items/products/add#4-choose-platforms).  
- The available **giveaways** come from your global giveaway list.

If you select multiple platforms, respondents will be asked to leave a review on each selected platform.

Once you select a platform, a settings panel will appear asking if you’d like to **require** your respondent to click off to that platform before continuing.

> **Do Not Show** means the “Review on [Platform]” button will not appear for that platform.

If selected, your respondent won't have an option to click off to a platform, and will only be able to leave the review on ReviewStream.

### 5. Modify Entry Validation
Change whether your survey requires **entry codes** or **order numbers** before respondents can access it.

| Option | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Yes** | Require a valid entry code/order number to access the survey |
| **No** | Allow anyone to enter the survey without validation |

Entry codes are created and managed under the **Validation Tools** section in the left-hand navigation.

### 6. Adjust Rating Settings
Modify how your **rating widget** behaves.

1. **Ask For Rating** – Show or hide the rating question.  
2. **Require Rating** – Make it mandatory to leave a rating before continuing.  
3. **Minimum Star Rating** – Decide which ratings can move forward to the external review platform(s).

For example, if you set your minimum star rating to 4, respondents who give a 4 or 5 will be directed to paste their review to external platforms.  
Those who rate lower (3 or below) will skip to the giveaway step.

### 7. Adjust Review Settings
Modify how the **review text box** functions.

1. **Ask For Review** – Show or hide the review text box.  
2. **Require Review** – Require respondents to write a review before continuing.  
3. **Minimum Review Length** – Enforce a minimum word or character count if desired.

---

### 8. Update Additional Settings

1. **Ask For Picture/Video?***  
   Pictures and videos can enhance the quality of customer reviews.  
   Decide whether to ask respondents to upload a photo or video with their feedback.  

2. **Enable Redirect?***  
   Redirect respondents to a custom URL upon survey completion.  

3. **Enable Terms of Service Agreement?***  
   Enable a Terms of Service (TOS) agreement to appear before respondents enter the survey.  
   This helps ensure reviews are unbiased by incentives.

### 9. Click “Save”
Once you’ve made your updates, click **Save** to apply changes to your survey.

Your edits take effect immediately, and respondents visiting your survey link will see the latest version.

## Tips

- Use **Edit Survey** instead of creating duplicates to keep your workspace organized.  
- When editing surveys actively in use, double-check that new settings (like validation or minimum ratings) align with your campaign goals.  
- If you make major structural changes (e.g., removing items), test the survey link before sharing.

## Next Step

Once your survey has been updated, you can continue by managing associated [review pages](../reviewpages/what-is-a-review-page) or [direct links](../directlinks/what-is-a-direct-link).
