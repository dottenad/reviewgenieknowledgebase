# What is a Review Page?

A **Review Page** in ReviewStream is a streamlined landing page designed to collect honest customer feedback and then guide the customer to leave a review on your preferred platform (like Google, Yelp, or Amazon).

Unlike Surveys, Review Pages are **not tied to giveaways or incentives**—they’re focused on gathering feedback first, then routing customers to leave a public review.

---

## 🔁 Review Flow

When a customer lands on your Review Page, they will:

1. Select the product, service, or business they interacted with
2. Provide a star rating (1–5 stars)
3. Optionally write a review and upload media
4. Get routed to the platform you want reviews on

The page is clean, simple, and optimized to reduce friction in the review process—ideal for ongoing feedback collection.

## 🎯 Ideal Use Cases

Review Pages are perfect for:

-   ⭐ Regular customer follow-up (e.g., after service completion)
-   🚪 Physical signage (QR code displays at brick-and-mortar locations)
-   ✉️ Email campaigns or post-purchase flows
-   📱 SMS follow-ups or in-app prompts

They offer a **lightweight and fast** experience focused on getting as many public reviews as possible, without asking for too much up front.

## 🌐 Platform Routing

Each Item connected to your Review Page can route to one or more **platforms** (Google, Yelp, Facebook, etc.). You can:

-   Customize where customers go based on their selection
-   Use ReviewStream’s internal logic to route high ratings to public platforms
-   Capture low ratings privately to prevent negative public reviews

> ⚖️ This helps you build trust while protecting your reputation.
