# What Is a Direct Link?  
A **Direct Link** in ReviewStream is a shortcut URL that takes your customer straight to the a review prompt or form, bypassing intermediate pages.  
Itâ€™s designed to make the review submission experience as frictionless as possible.

## Why Use a Direct Link?

Direct Links are helpful because they:

- ðŸŽ¯ Reduce steps â€” customers click and go directly to the review form  
- âš¡ Improve conversion by removing extra navigation  
- ðŸ“¤ Are ideal for embedding in emails, SMS, receipts, or QR codes  
- ðŸ§© Can be customized per item (product, service, location) for precise routing

## How Direct Links Work

1. You generate a Direct Link for a specific **item** or **campaign**.  
2. You distribute that link to your customer â€” in email, text, print, or QR code.  
3. When your customer clicks it, theyâ€™re taken straight into the review prompt (star rating, feedback, etc.).  
4. After submission, ReviewStream handles routing logic (e.g. sending them to a review platform or follow-up screen).

## Use Cases for Direct Links

- **Post-purchase emails** â€” include the link so customers can leave a review immediately  
- **SMS / Text messages** â€” shorter path to feedback means higher response  
- **Receipts or invoices** â€” print or embed a QR code that maps to a direct link  
- **Campaigns** â€” segment links by product or service to see which items get more reviews

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use **short, user-friendly alias URLs** when possible  
- Combine with **utm parameters** to track source/channel performance  
- Be mindful of routing logic â€” ensure the direct link still respects any rating thresholds or validation  
- Test the link across devices (desktop, mobile) to verify behavior
