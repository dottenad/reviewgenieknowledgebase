# What Is a Giveaway?

A **Giveaway** in ReviewStream is a promotional incentive offered to customers in exchange for providing their review on your product or service. Giveaways are a powerful way to increase review volume by offering something valuable—like a gift card, discount, or prize—after the customer completes your review flow.

ReviewStream makes it easy to manage, track, and fulfill these offers while staying compliant with platform rules and guidelines.

## 🔐 How Giveaways Work

Here’s how the giveaway system typically functions:

1. **You create a Giveaway** tied to a specific survey or campaign.
2. Customers are asked to leave a review on your chosen platform (e.g., Amazon, Google, Etsy).
3. After completing the review and meeting the requirements, the customer is presented with the Giveaway offer.
4. ReviewStream tracks entries and helps manage fulfillment securely.

Giveaways are **only triggered** when the customer completes all required steps (e.g., leaves a review, uploads proof, meets star-rating minimum, etc.).

## ✅ Requirements and Validation

Each Giveaway is tied to the **Item** and **Platform** rules you've configured. You can enforce things like:

-   Minimum star rating
-   Proof of review (screenshot, link)
-   Order number validation
-   One entry per order or user

This ensures you're only rewarding legitimate participants and discourages abuse.
