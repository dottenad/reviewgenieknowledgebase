# What Is a Coupon Giveaway?

A **Coupon Giveaway** in ReviewStream is a reward type where your customer receives a **coupon code** after completing a review. It's a simple yet effective incentive—customers complete your review flow, and they’re emailed a coupon they can use on their next purchase.

This giveaway type is ideal for driving **repeat business**, **customer loyalty**, and **follow-up sales**—all while boosting your reviews.

## 🧾 What Counts as a Coupon?

In ReviewStream, a **coupon is always a coupon code**. While you can use it to promote different kinds of offers, the end result is always the same: the customer receives a code they can use online or in-store.

You can structure your offer around:

-   **Percentage-off discounts** (e.g., `SAVE20` for 20% off)
-   **Fixed amount discounts** (e.g., `$10OFF`)
-   **Free shipping offers** (e.g., `FREESHIP`)
-   **BOGO-style promotions** (e.g., `BUY1GET1`)
-   **Limited-time codes** (e.g., `SUMMER25`, `WELCOME10`)

> No matter the promotion, your customer receives a code they can apply to their next order.

You’ll define this code during setup, and ReviewStream will handle automatic email delivery after the customer completes their survey and meets your review requirements.
