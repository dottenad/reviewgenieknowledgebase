There are two types of coupon codes in ReviewStream:

### üîí Single-Use Coupon

A **Single-Use Coupon** is a unique code that can be redeemed **only once** by a single customer.

-   Once a customer uses this code, it becomes invalid for all others.
-   Ideal for personalized or limited-use promotions.
-   Helps prevent abuse by limiting the code to one redemption.

**How to input single-use codes**:  
Enter multiple codes separated by commas (e.g., `ABC123, DEF456, GHI789`).

### üîÅ Multi-Use Coupon

A **Multi-Use Coupon** is a shared code that can be redeemed **multiple times** by different customers.

-   The same code is distributed to all eligible respondents.
-   Useful for broad promotions or general discounts.
-   Easier to manage when you don‚Äôt need to track individual redemptions.

**How to input a multi-use code**:  
Enter a single code (e.g., `SAVE10`) that will be used across all qualifying customers.

> üí° **Tip**: Use **Single-Use** for high-value or one-time offers. Use **Multi-Use** for ongoing discounts or wide promotions.

### 7. Customize Email Template

After selecting your coupon type, you can customize the **email template** that will be sent to eligible respondents.

You can update:

-   **Subject Line** ‚Äì what shows up in the subject line of the user‚Äôs inbox.
-   **Email Template (HTML)** ‚Äì full HTML customization of the email body.

#### Available Dynamic Tags

You can use dynamic placeholders to personalize the email content:

-   `{{firstName}}` ‚Äî The recipient's first name.
-   `{{couponCode}}` ‚Äî The assigned coupon code (based on your setup).

Example:  
`Hi {{firstName}}, here is your coupon code: {{couponCode}}`

> üõ†Ô∏è These tags are automatically replaced with real values when the email is sent.

Use the **Preview Email** button to test how your template will look before finalizing.
