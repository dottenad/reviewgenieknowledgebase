### 5. Upload Image (optional)

You may upload an image that visually represents your coupon. While not required, including an image can improve trust and recall for the respondent.

### 6. Select Coupon Type

There are two different coupon types: single-use and multi-use. A single-use coupon code is a unique code that can be redeemed only once by a single user. A multi-use coupon code can be redeemed multiple times by different users. For example, a single-use coupon code can be the value "abc." If a customer uses the code "abc" this code will not work again. However, if you make "abc" a multi-use coupon code, this coupon code value can be used multiple times.

Input the exact **coupon code** you want delivered to respondents (e.g., `SAVE15`, `FREESHIP`, `WELCOME10`). ReviewStream will automatically email this code to users who qualify.
