### Edit Single-Use Coupon Code

    A **Single-Use Coupon** is a unique code that can be redeemed **only once** by a single customer.

    -   Once ReviewStream sends a single-use coupon code, it will not send the same coupon code again.
    -   Coupon codes are distributed in the order they appear in your list‚Äîfirst to last. For example, if you enter ABC123, DEF456, GHI789 and a customer completes the survey, they will receive the first available code, ABC123. This leaves DEF456 and GHI789 remaining. Single-use coupon codes are sent one at a time until all codes in the list have been used.
    -   Helps prevent abuse by limiting the code to one send.

    **How to input single-use codes**:
    Enter multiple codes separated by commas (e.g., `ABC123, DEF456, GHI789`).

    **Coupon codes will send** until there are no more coupon codes left in the list.
