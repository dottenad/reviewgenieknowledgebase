# What Is a Product Giveaway?

A **Product Giveaway** in ReviewStream is a physical item that you give away, free of charge, to your respondent for providing their review on your product or service.

Unlike a coupon giveaway or an eGift giveaway, **Product Giveaways are a physical item that require shipping**.

## 📦 What Qualifies as a Product?

In the context of a Product Giveaway, a **Product** is:

-   A physical item that you will ship to your customer upon their successful completion of your survey
-   You ship the product giveaway to your customer
-   Trackable with a tracking code

Examples of a product giveaway include:

-   🎧 A pair of wireless earbuds
-   🧼 A set of handmade soaps
-   🏋️ A home gym product
-   📦 Any physical product that requires shipping

> ❌ **Not considered a Product Giveaway:** a Coupon or an eGift Card.

3. **Customer Completes Your Survey** and selects your product giveaway as their free item.
4. **Automatically or Manually Fulfill** your customer's product giveaway selection based on the SKU value of the selected giveaway.
5. **Customer Receives Their Free Product!**
