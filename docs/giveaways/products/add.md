# How to Add a Product Giveaway

A **Product Giveaway** in ReviewStream is a physical item (such as a hat or a coffee mug) that you give away, free of charge, to your respondent for providing their review on your product or service.

Unlike a coupon giveaway or an eGift giveaway, **Product Giveaways are a physical item that require shipping**.

### 5. Upload Image (optional)

Uploading a business image will show your respondent an image of the business they interacted with. Uploading an image provides valuable visual recall to your respondent to ensure they are selecting the correct business that they had an interaction with.

### 6. Add Description (optional)

Enter a description of this product giveaway. This value will be shown to your respondent, so be sure to add something that properly describes this product giveaway. Descriptions come in handy for if you have assigned multiple giveaways to one item. This way the respondent can read about each giveaway before making a decision on one or the other.
